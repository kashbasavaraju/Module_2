# Loan Qualifier App

This application allows users to see whether they qualify for loans from an existing data set provided by a 'daily rate sheet' by entering their credit score, monthly debt, monthly income, desired loan amount, and their home value. From these inputs, Debt to Income Ratio, and loan to home value is calculated. The loans from the daily rate sheet are then filtered based on if the ratios fit the criteria for the existing loans.

Using this application will allow users to quickly identify and access loans they qualify for as opposed to having to filter loans out manually that is usually done by a third party.
